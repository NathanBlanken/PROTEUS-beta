# microbubble-simulator
Solves a Rayleigh-Plesset equation to simulate the radial response and the echo from a lipid-coated microbubble.

Simulates the acoustic response of a microbubble. The bubble responses is computed with a Marmottant-type Rayleigh-Plesset equation, which takes viscous, radiation, shell, and thermal damping into account. The pulse shape is based on the pulse from the P4-1 transducer.

VariablesList.m explains the input and output variables of the simulator.
